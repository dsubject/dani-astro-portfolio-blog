    <h2>How I built Subject Designs' Website</h2>
    <p>This website was rebuilt with a strong focus on sustainability. The original site, hosted on Squarespace, scored poorly in performance with only 47% on PageSpeed Insights. My goal was to redesign it with sustainability in mind, resulting in a cleaner, more simplified layout optimized for various device sizes, minimal JavaScript, and low page weight. However, since the site is photo-intensive, achieving sustainability posed a unique challenge.</p>
    <p>Optimizations included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Image Compression: All images were optimized to be under 200 KB to reduce load times and environmental impact.</li>
        <li>WebP Format: WebP versions of images were used where possible to ensure efficient loading.</li>
        <li>Lazy Loading: Images were lazy-loaded to minimize initial page load times and reduce resource usage.</li>
        <li>Caching: Implemented caching strategies to reduce server load and improve performance for repeat visitors.</li>
        <li>Srcset for Responsive Images: Utilized srcset to serve the appropriate image size based on the user's device, reducing unnecessary data transfer.</li>
        <li>Performance and Sustainability: The site scores 100% on Lighthouse for performance, accessibility, and best practices, and received an A+ rating from the Web Carbon Calculator.</li>
    </ul>
